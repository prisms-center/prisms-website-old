            My major research interest is in understanding the inter-relationships between processing, alloying,
            microstructure and properties in metallic materials – and in incorporating this knowledge into computational
            tools for use in research, education and engineering. An important part of my research is development of
            Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) tools – and thus collaborations with other
            computational and experimental groups are an essential element of my work. Central to my research are
            investigations on the evolution of microstructures - current examples include precipitate evolution,
            recrystallization and grain growth and texture development in magnesium, aluminum and titanium alloys. I am
            also interested in mechanical behavior of these materials, with an emphasis on development of mechanistic
            and phenomenological understanding of the influence of microstructure on properties such as strength,
            ductility and fatigue resistance.

            Broadly, my research interests are in developing mathematical and computational models of physical systems.
            With relevance to the PRISMS Center this consists of continuum scale models of coupled mechano-chemical
            phenomena in materials physics. Typically, the problems that I have worked on have been nonlinear, such as
            finite strain elasto-plasticity and damage, and mass transport. Of special interest to me are the physics
            described by high-order pdes such as strain gradient theories and the Cahn-Hilliard equation, and the
            numerical methods needed for computations with these models.

            My research area if focused on the mechanical behavior of structural metal alloys and specifically
            on fatigue and creep. For the past three years my group has been involved in using ultrasonic
            fatigue to examine the very high cycle fatigue behavior of magnesium, aluminum, titanium alloys
            and nickel-base superalloys. Our goals are to understand the mechanisms of fatigue crack initiation
            and crack growth where fatigue lifetimes may be as long as 109 cycles and to understand how
            microstructural variability can be incorporated into probabilistic models for fatigue life prediction.
            My research group is also investigating the influence of composition and microstructure on creep
            behavior in magnesium alloys. Here the emphasis is on understanding the role of microstructural
            stability during creep in die cast magnesium alloys intend for elevated temperature applications.
