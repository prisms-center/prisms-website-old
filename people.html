            Major research focus is on understanding the inter-relationships between processing,
            microstructure and properties in advanced metallic materials and the utilization of
            this knowledge to engineer metallic materials for use in engineering applications.
            Central to this research are investigations on the mechanical behavior of materials,
            with an emphasis on developing both a mechanistic and phenomenological understanding
            of fatigue and creep processes. Current examples include development of micro-mechanical
            models of deformation in reinforced metals and investigations on creep and fatigue of
            aluminum and magnesium-matrix composites and titanium-aluminides. An additional area of
            interest is in the implementation of new metals technology. This includes development of
            methodologies for insuring structural durability and for assessing manufacturing costs.

            Broadly, my research interests are in developing mathematical and computational models of physical systems.
            With relevance to the PRISMS Center this consists of continuum scale models of coupled mechano-chemical
            phenomena in materials physics. Typically, the problems that I have worked on have been nonlinear, such as
            finite strain elasto-plasticity and damage, and mass transport. Of special interest to me are the physics
            described by high-order pdes such as strain gradient theories and the Cahn-Hilliard equation, and the
            numerical methods needed for computations with these models.

            My research focuses on computational and theoretical investigations of the evolution of
            microstructures and nanostructures during processing and operation. These investigations
            facilitate the understanding of the underlying physics of materials to aid us in designing
            advanced materials with desirable properties and in developing manufacturing processes
            that are the most cost-effective. The topics include coarsening in elastically stressed solids,

            Prof. Sundararaghavan develops multi-scale computational methods for polycrystalline alloys,

            effect of microstructure on the overall deformation, fatigue, failure, thermal transport and

            and a new finite element homogenization approach for modeling oxidative degradation in high
            temperature fiber reinforced ceramic matrix composites. He has made seminal contributions

            My research area if focused on the mechanical behavior of structural metal alloys and specifically
            on fatigue and creep. For the past three years my group has been involved in using ultrasonic
            fatigue to examine the very high cycle fatigue behavior of magnesium, aluminum, titanium alloys
            and nickel-base superalloys. Our goals are to understand the mechanisms of fatigue crack initiation
            and crack growth where fatigue lifetimes may be as long as 109 cycles and to understand how
            microstructural variability can be incorporated into probabilistic models for fatigue life prediction.
            My research group is also investigating the influence of composition and microstructure on creep
            behavior in magnesium alloys. Here the emphasis is on understanding the role of microstructural
            stability during creep in die cast magnesium alloys intend for elevated temperature applications.
            These research efforts are funded by NSF, AFOSR, DARPA, Ford Motor Company and USAMP.
